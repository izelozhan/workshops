<b>Financial Calculators</b>
<p>This application is designed for a financial organization aiming to offer a suite of helpful financial calculators to its clients. The purpose of the application is to simplify complex financial computations by providing user-friendly tools that assist in informed financial decision-making.</p>

<b>Calculator 1: A Mortgage Calculator </b> 
<p>This module is used to calculate how much a monthly payment for a loan would beâ€”excluding any additional costs such as insurance or taxes. In addition to the monthly payment, it also calculates the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.</p>

<b>Accepts:</b>
  - Loan principal (total amount borrowed)
  - Annual interest rate (as a percentage)
  - Loan term (in years) <br>
  
<b>Calculates:</b>
  - Monthly payment using the amortization formula
  - Total interest paid over the life of the loan <br>
  
<b>Displays:</b>
  - Monthly payment
  - Total interest

<b>Calculator 2: Future Value </b>
<p>Determines the future value of a one-time deposit assuming compound interest. Useful for estimating the value of a Certificate of Deposit (CD) or similar investment when it matures.</p>

<b>Accepts:</b>
  - Initial deposit amount
  - Annual interest rate (as a percentage)
  - Number of years (investment duration)<br>
  
<b>Calculates:</b>
  - Future value using compound interest formula
  - Total interest earned<br>
  
<b>Displays:</b>
  - Future value at maturity

<b>Interesting part of this code for me is: </b>

<p>I found it quite interesting to try implementing a complex formula as code and to work on understanding it. To make it easier to understand, I broke the operations in the formula into smaller parts, which made the main formula I used cleaner and more readable.</p>
